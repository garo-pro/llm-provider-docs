- [SchemaFlow: Agentic Database Change Impact Analysis, SQL Generation, and Eval Guardrails](/cookbook/examples/partners/schemaflow_design_guide/schemaflow_cookbook.md): Build a staged SchemaFlow pipeline with the OpenAI Agents SDK for database change parsing, impact analysis, rollout planning, SQL generation, guardrails, artifacts, optional File Search grounding, and Promptfoo evals.
- [Moving from OpenAI Evals to Promptfoo](/cookbook/examples/evaluation/moving-from-openai-evals-to-promptfoo.md): Manually recreate OpenAI Evals evaluations in Promptfoo, then run and validate them.
- [Getting Started with OpenAI Models on Amazon Bedrock](/cookbook/examples/partners/aws/openai_models_with_amazon_bedrock.md): Learn how to invoke an OpenAI-compatible Amazon Bedrock endpoint using the OpenAI Python SDK, along with equivalent cURL examples, and leverage Responses API capabilities available through Amazon Bedrock.
- [Macro Evals for Agentic Systems](/cookbook/examples/partners/macro_evals_for_agentic_systems/macro_evals_for_agentic_systems.md): A cookbook showing how to evaluate multi-agent systems by clustering trace-level eval signals into recurring behavior patterns and drilling into high-impact patterns.
- [Build an Agent Improvement Loop with Traces, Evals, and Codex](/cookbook/examples/agents_sdk/agent_improvement_loop.md): Build a trace-driven improvement loop that turns human and model feedback into Promptfoo evals, HALO-ranked harness changes, and a Codex handoff.
- [Evaluating Grounded Spatial Reasoning with GPT-5.5](/cookbook/examples/multimodal/grounded_spatial_reasoning_layouts.md): Build a spec-first floorplan layout workflow with vision, structured outputs, and deterministic spatial evals.
- [Build iterative repair loops with Codex](/cookbook/examples/codex/build_iterative_repair_loops_with_codex.md): A Codex cookbook showing how to use review, repair, and validation loops to improve technical documentation artifacts.
- [Migrate a Legacy Codebase with Sandbox Agents](/cookbook/examples/agents_sdk/sandboxed-code-migration/sandboxed_code_migration_agent.md): Build a sandboxed code-migration agent that splits a modernization campaign into isolated tasks and returns validated patch bundles.
