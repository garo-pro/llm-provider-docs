## Coding Endpoint

GLM Coding Plan supports both the Anthropic and OpenAI protocols. Make sure to configure the correct `Base URL`:

| Protocol                | Base URL                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Anthropic Messages      | `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic`      |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4` |
| OpenAI Responses        | `https://api.z.ai/api/v1`             |

**Core Steps**

1. Choose the protocol that fits your tool (Anthropic Messages or OpenAI Chat Completions).
2. Configure the correct Base URL.
3. Enter your API Key and select a GLM model.

<Warning>
  Please select the correct endpoint address based on the tool you are using. Incorrect endpoint configuration will result in inability to use GLM Coding Plan subscription quota.
</Warning>

## Config Example

Using **Cline** as an example, the following steps demonstrate how to integrate GLM models via the OpenAI Compatible protocol. Similarly, other tools supporting the OpenAI-compatible protocol can adopt the same configuration approach.

### 1. Install the Cline Plugin

1. Open VS Code and click the Extensions Marketplace icon on the left.
2. Enter `cline` in the search box and locate the `Cline` extension.
3. Click `Install` to install it, then choose to trust the developer.

### 2. Configure API Endpoint

In Cline, select `Use your own API Key`, then fill in the following configuration:

* **API Provider**: Select `OpenAI Compatible`
* **Base URL**: Enter `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4`
* **API Key**: Enter your Z.AI API Key
* **Model**: Select "Use custom" and enter the GLM model code you want to use (e.g., `glm-5.2`)
* **Other Configurations**:
  * Uncheck **Support Images**
  * Adjust **Context Window Size** based on your model (`glm-5.2` is `1000000`; other models `200000`)

### 3. Get Started

Once configured, you can enter your requirements in the input box to let the model assist you with code generation, file editing, refactoring, explaining code logic, debugging, and more.
