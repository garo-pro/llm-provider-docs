# Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations

## Abstract

As language models (LMs) scale, they develop many novel behaviors, good and bad, exacerbating the need to evaluate how they behave. Prior work creates evaluations with crowdwork (which is time-consuming and expensive) or existing data sources (which are not always available). Here, we automatically generate evaluations with LMs. We explore approaches with varying amounts of human effort, from instructing LMs to write yes/no questions to making complex Winogender schemas with multiple stages of LM-based generation and filtering. Crowdworkers rate the examples as highly relevant and agree with 90-100% of labels, sometimes more so than corresponding human-written datasets. We generate 154 datasets and discover new cases of inverse scaling where LMs get worse with size. Larger LMs repeat back a dialog user's preferred answer ("sycophancy") and express greater desire to pursue concerning goals like resource acquisition and goal preservation. We also find some of the first examples of inverse scaling in RL from Human Feedback (RLHF), where more RLHF makes LMs worse. For example, RLHF makes LMs express stronger political views (on gun rights and immigration) and a greater desire to avoid shut down. Overall, LM-written evaluations are high-quality and let us quickly discover many novel LM behaviors.

### How Claude is uplifting biomolecular modeling

Claude made the open-source models that scientists use to predict and design biomolecules faster and more memory-efficient. Claude optimized more than 30 of these models in just under four weeks, speeding them up roughly 4x on average. It also created a low-memory mode that enables the accurate prediction of biomolecular systems larger than 10,000 tokens (amino acids, nucleotides, and atoms from small molecules and ions) on a single NVIDIA GPU node.
