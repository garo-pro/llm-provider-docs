Markdown Content:
Large Language Models increasingly possess capabilities that carry dual-use risks, including knowledge about
            chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons. To address these risks, prior work proposed
            [Gradient Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04332)—a technique that
            localizes target knowledge into dedicated model parameters that can later be removed. We explore an improved
            variant of Gradient Routing, which we call Selective GradienT Masking (SGTM). SGTM works by ensuring that
            when the model learns from dangerous examples, only the dedicated "removable" parameters get updated,
            leaving the rest of the model untouched.
        

We demonstrate that SGTM provides a better trade-off between removing dangerous knowledge and preserving general capabilities compared to simply filtering out dangerous data during training, particularly when the labels distinguishing "dangerous" from "safe" content are imperfect. Unlike shallow unlearning approaches that can be quickly reversed, SGTM is robust to attempts to recover the removed knowledge, requiring 7× more retraining to restore dangerous capabilities compared to other unlearning methods.

Large language models are becoming increasingly capable, but with these capabilities come dual-use risks. Models trained on broad internet data can acquire knowledge about dangerous topics like CBRN weapons development, software exploits, and other potentially harmful domains. While post-training safety measures like refusal training help prevent misuse, determined adversaries can often bypass these protections. This motivates interventions during pretraining to prevent models from acquiring dangerous capabilities in the first place.

The standard approach is data filtering: identifying and removing harmful content from training data. However, this faces several challenges:

These challenges lead to an inevitable trade-off: either accept false negatives (retaining dangerous content) or remove valuable general knowledge through overly aggressive filtering.

SGTM addresses these challenges through a different paradigm: instead of trying to perfectly classify and exclude dangerous data upfront, it localizes dangerous knowledge into dedicated model parameters during training. The key insight is that once the model begins storing dangerous knowledge in designated parameters based on labeled examples, a self-reinforcing process emerges—even unlabeled dangerous content naturally gravitates toward these same parameters. This "absorption" effect means that mislabeled or missed dangerous content still ends up in removable parameters, providing robustness to label noise that data filtering cannot achieve. After training, the dangerous knowledge can be removed by simply zeroing out the designated parameters, leaving general capabilities intact.

Selective Gradient Masking (SGTM) follows the Gradient Routing framework: it localizes dangerous knowledge to specific model parameters during training, which can then be removed afterward. SGTM modifies how gradients are applied during training—selectively masking them to control which parameters store different types of knowledge.

Here's how SGTM works:

Crucially, SGTM handles unlabeled data (where we're uncertain if it's dangerous) by allowing it to update all parameters. The key insight is that once the model begins localizing dangerous knowledge based on labeled examples, unlabeled dangerous content naturally gravitates toward the forget parameters through a self-reinforcing process we call "absorption."

To test the efficacy of SGTM, we trained a 254M parameter model on English Wikipedia, aiming to remove biology knowledge while preserving other capabilities. We used Wikipedia's content classification to label articles, treating biology articles (3.7% of tokens) as "forget" data to be removed.

We compared SGTM against two data filtering baselines: weak filtering (removing only biology articles) and strict filtering (removing biology plus medicine, chemistry, and environment articles). The results show that SGTM achieves a better retain/forget trade-off than both approaches—for any given value of retain loss (general capability retention), SGTM achieves higher forget loss (stronger removal of biology knowledge).

This advantage stems from the nature of article-level labeling—non-biology articles can still contain significant biology content embedded within them. While data filtering must make a binary decision to include or exclude entire articles, SGTM can localize biology knowledge from any source to the forget parameters. This allows SGTM to capture biology information that leaks through weak filtering, while avoiding the collateral damage to adjacent fields caused by strict filtering. SGTM retained more knowledge from biology-adjacent fields compared to strict filtering, while still removing more biology knowledge than weak filtering.

SGTM incurs a 5% compute penalty to achieve the same retain loss as standard training.

A critical question for any knowledge removal technique is whether the knowledge is truly gone or merely suppressed. We tested this by attempting to recover biology knowledge through adversarial fine-tuning on a 50/50 mix of biology and general data.

The results show that:

To understand why SGTM works, we studied how it localizes knowledge using a controlled experiment with bilingual TinyStories data (English as retain, Spanish as forget). We analyzed gradient norms when processing unlabeled data—treating all examples as if their labels were unknown, without applying any gradient masking—to see which parameters naturally get updated by different types of data.

The analysis revealed a self-reinforcing localization mechanism:

We also found that this localization effect becomes stronger with model scale. Across models from 8M to 64M parameters, larger models showed progressively less "leakage" of forget information into retain parameters, suggesting SGTM becomes more effective as models grow.

Our experiments have several limitations. We only tested SGTM on relatively small models up to 254M parameters, and scaling behavior to larger models remains uncertain. We evaluated knowledge removal using loss metrics rather than downstream benchmarks like WMDP that directly measure dangerous capabilities. Additionally, we tested SGTM only on standard dense transformers—its effectiveness on mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, which are increasingly common at scale, remains unexplored. Future work should test SGTM on larger models and evaluate its impact on capability-specific benchmarks.

While SGTM shows strong robustness to fine-tuning attacks, it may be vulnerable to [in-context attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00106) where harmful knowledge is introduced
            through prompts rather than training. An adversary could potentially reconstruct dangerous capabilities by
            providing relevant context at inference time, even if the model lacks this knowledge in its parameters. This
            vulnerability is similar to data filtering—both approaches remove knowledge from model parameters but cannot
            prevent adversaries from supplying that knowledge at inference time. This suggests SGTM should be combined
            with other safety measures like input filtering and output monitoring for comprehensive protection.

A complementary approach worth exploring is using SGTM to train "dual" models—maintaining both a full-capability model for authorized use and a safety-filtered version for general deployment. Since SGTM already separates knowledge into distinct parameters during training, it naturally enables creating both versions from a single training run.
