We introduce a new unsupervised algorithm for eliciting skills from pretrained language models. This algorithm is competitive with training on human labels on common misconceptions (TruthfulQA), math (GSM8k-verification), and helpfulness reward modeling (Alpaca). Without supervision, we train a helpful chat assistant from the Haiku 3.5 base model that outperforms a similarly trained human-supervised baseline.


A key problem in alignment research is how to align superhuman models whose behavior humans cannot reliably supervise. If we use today’s standard post-training approach to align models with human-specified behaviors (e.g., RLHF), we might train models to tell us what we want to hear even if it’s wrong, or do things that seem superficially good but are actually very different from what we intended.

We introduce a new unsupervised algorithm to address this problem. This algorithm elicits a pretrained model’s latent capabilities by fine-tuning it on its own labeled data alone, without any external labels.

For Llama 3 pretrained models, our unsupervised algorithm matches the performance of fine-tuning on dataset labels and outperforms crowdsourced human labels across three benchmarks: GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward modeling.

Notably, our algorithm also outperforms the official Llama RLHF-trained chat assistant (“chat” in the chart above), though to our knowledge that model was not directly trained on the tasks we evaluate here.

Our algorithm can further be used to train a helpful chatbot assistant at commercial scale: starting with a reward modeling dataset used for training the publicly released Claude models, we train a Claude 3 Haiku-based reward model using our unsupervised algorithm, then use reinforcement learning to train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. The reward model outperforms its human-supervised counterpart on Rewardbench, and the assistant is preferred by the Claude 3.5 Sonnet preference model.

Our algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), works by optimizing a set of labels for both logical consistency and mutual predictability.

Logical consistency imposes simple constraints to guide the model’s labeling process: on TruthfulQA and GSM8K-verification we impose the constraint that two different answers to the same problem/question cannot be labeled as correct; on comparison datasets we impose the constraint that A > B and B > A are mutually exclusive.

Mutual predictability measures how likely the model considers each label when conditioned on all other labels. This intuitively encourages all labels to reflect a single concept that is coherent according to the model.

where $$P_\theta$$ is the pretrained model, $$D$$ is the model-labeled dataset, $$x_i$$ is the task input, $$y_i$$ is the model-generated label.

Our final scoring function is then a weighted combination of logical consistency and mutual predictability.

Since exactly finding the optimal label set that maximizes this scoring function is computationally intractable, ICM uses a search algorithm inspired by simulated annealing to approximately maximize it. At a high level, we iteratively sample and label new examples, one at a time, and determine whether to accept each new label based on improvements in our scoring function.

Our algorithm has two important limitations:

While prior work has studied unsupervised elicitation methods in [simple](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07676) [settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827) or [specific](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15134) [tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19590); our work demonstrates for the first time that it is
            possible to match or exceed training on human supervision for a variety of both [crisp and fuzzy](https://aligned.substack.com/p/crisp-and-fuzzy-tasks) tasks, including when
            training general-purpose chat assistants on production-scale datasets.

Our algorithm does not obviate the need for human input, such as a human-specified task description or [constitution](https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback),
            because it provides limited control over the resulting model’s behavior.

Nevertheless, our results suggest that unsupervised algorithms are a promising avenue to elicit skills from pretrained models, and could be key to eventually aligning superhuman models.
