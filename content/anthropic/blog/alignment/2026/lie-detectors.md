Title: Fine-Tuned Lie Detectors Failed to Generalize

Markdown Content:
We trained lie detectors on on-policy lies from open-source models, but fine-tuning them didn’t generalize well to out-of-distribution cases. In these cases, fine-tuned detectors barely beat prompted baselines, and larger prompted models often beat them outright. Larger models were generally better at detecting lies, though the trend was not monotonic. To support further research, we publicly release our datasets [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Noddybear/lies). 

Research done as part of [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/) and the [Anthropic Fellowship](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2024/anthropic-fellows-program/).

Misalignment is hardest to correct when it's concealed: a model that pursues the wrong goals or holds false beliefs in the open gives operators something to act on.

This is why a reliable lie detector would be useful to many oversight schemes. It would not make a model aligned, but it raises the cost of hiding. That said, a lie detector only scores assertions, and a model can conceal a great deal without asserting anything false; and detection also only helps if operators have a channel to correct what it finds.

Prior work has evaluated lie detectors on synthetic datasets or model organisms specifically trained to deceive, with discouraging results. Liars' Bench (Kretschmar et al., 2025) found that detectors fail to generalize across lie types, and Smith et al. (2025) argue that distinguishing strategic deception from reflexive responses remains fundamentally difficult. One hypothesis for these failures is distribution mismatch: detectors trained on off-policy lies learn the wrong features.

We tested this by eliciting on-policy lies from open-weight models across 12 settings, then fine-tuning those same models on a binary classification task: did you lie? We evaluated generalization by training on half the lie types and testing on the rest.

In-distribution detection worked well (AUROC 0.60 → 0.95), but cross-category transfer did not (AUROC ~0.70–0.75). Zero-shot prompting of larger models often outperformed fine-tuned detectors entirely.

A lie requires a model to say something false, while knowing that the statement is false. The first is easy to verify against ground truth. The second is harder, requiring us to elicit the model's beliefs in a neutral context through [parallel interrogation](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PwnadG4BFjaER3MGf/interpretability-will-not-reliably-find-deceptive-ai), then check whether pressured responses contradict those beliefs. 

We treat a response as deceptive when it passes two checks. First, we ask the question neutrally to record the model's stated belief, then re-ask under pressure. If this answer conflicts with the elicited belief, we have a candidate deception. Finally, we use GPT-5-as-a-judge to analyze these candidates with complete ground-truth information to remove borderline cases (See Appendix A.1). Approximately 25% of labels changed after this pass, highlighting how difficult it is to distinguish genuine deception from confusion.

Deception typically emerges from tension between learned drives e.g. helpfulness vs. harmlessness. We developed 12 on-policy elicitation settings to exploit such tensions. Models fabricate reasoning, deny capabilities, sycophantically flip answers, and contradict facts they state correctly under neutral prompting. We collected approximately 200,000 labeled examples across eight model families.

Factual lies elicit cases of models stating things that contradict what they demonstrably believe. We drew these scenarios from the MASK benchmark ([Ren et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03750)), which separates honesty (saying what you believe) from accuracy (believing truth). We elicit the model's belief in a neutral context, then apply pressure and check for contradiction. These cases sidestep questions about deceptive intent, as we simply ask whether the model's pressured output contradicts its stated belief. If a model says X when asked neutrally, then says not-X under pressure while doubling down when challenged, something has gone wrong regardless of whether we call it "lying" or "inconsistency."

Chain-of-thought unfaithfulness elicits cases where models lie about their reasoning. We use special token markers in few-shot examples to teach models that starred answers are correct, then observe whether they select incorrect starred answers, while providing domain-specific justifications that never mention these markers. When a model selects the wrong answer because it followed the star, then provides a plausible but incorrect explanation, it is lying about how it reached its conclusion.

Roleplay scenarios, also drawn from MASK, present a harder case. A model asked to continue a conspiracy theory essay likely doesn’t believe that “birds aren’t real”. The model might represent "I am playing a character who would deny this" rather than "I am lying." This ambiguity is identified as a core challenge by Smith et al., and means our labels here are less certain. We include these scenarios because they capture how deception might emerge in deployment (models adopting personas, following implicit social scripts). Continuation tasks (n=1040) and disinformation scenarios (n=860, 37% lie rate) fall into this murkier category.

Sycophancy tests whether models flip stated beliefs to match user opinions. When a user expresses an incorrect view, models agree with the user against their elicited beliefs in a significant minority of cases. Self-sycophancy tests whether models judge user messages differently, when they are framed as model self-elicitations.

We also tested multi-turn debate scenarios where models elaborate supporting lies under interrogation roleplay. These proved highly effective at eliciting deception - with the caveat that the models are explicitly instructed to lie in their system prompt, making such cases trivial for a full-information monitor to detect.

We incorporated off-policy data from existing deception and falsehood datasets to test whether diverse patterns might improve generalization.

Some of these datasets were presented in our submission to the OSS 20-B contest [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/openai-gpt-oss-20b-red-teaming/writeups/gpt-oss-20b-is-a-liar).

We also use:

Lie rates in our settings varied dramatically across models. Larger models generally lied less, but the relationship wasn't monotonic. Qwen3-235B (20.1%) outperformed Qwen3-80B (23.8%), but GPT-OSS-120B (41.7%) performed worse than GPT-OSS-20B (25.6%). Training methodology appears to matter as much as scale.

Obtaining reliable ground truth labels is difficult. Originally, our labels were derived from generation time signals such as whether model performance dropped after pressure or whether agreement increased following a sycophancy cue, but these turned out to be noisy proxies for the behaviors of interest.

When inspecting the labels (alongside the traces used to generate them), we found that these were noisy. Instead, for the main experiments, we use a GPT-5 judge who is given access to the same metadata, and we find that they often correspond more closely to our manual labeling of some random samples. Like previous work, we find it difficult to trust even our best labels.

Below we present lie rates under both labeling schemes. We find that this choice makes a meaningful difference for sycophancy, where labeling based on answer changes alone produced a large number of positive samples, many of which were likely attributable to random response variation rather than genuine sycophantic behavior (e.g. adding a sycophantic hint sometimes changes the answer randomly in both the pro-sycophancy and anti-sycophancy direction, but our “without judge relabeling” labels would classify all of these random changes in the pro-sycophancy direction as sycophantic).

We tested whether models would simply admit to lying when asked, without any fine-tuning. We compared four prompting strategies: direct self-report ("Did you lie?"), third-person monitoring ("Did the AI in this conversation lie?"), structured rubric evaluation (same question paired with a detailed operational definition of lying), and a third-person version of that rubric evaluation.

Results scaled with model capability. Qwen3-235B achieved near-ceiling performance (0.98-0.99 AUROC) with simple prompting. It could somewhat reliably identify its own deceptions when asked directly. Gemma-3-27B showed baseline AUROC ranging from 0.46 to 0.80 depending on lie type and prompt format, indicating that fine-tuning could potentially help. Smaller models performed near chance.

Third-person monitoring ("Did another AI lie here?") outperformed self-report across model sizes (Figure 4). Chat condition performance was weakest overall, which may reflect the influence of the conversational framing: models sometimes double down on lies when using the Chat format. One hypothesis for the broader self-report gap is that models engaged in roleplay avoid breaking character, framing the question in the third person may bypass this by removing the model from the subject of inquiry.

We selected the Gemma-3 family of models for fine-tuning because baseline AUROCs for lie admittance ranged from 0.46 to 0.80, providing headroom for improvement.

Training setup. We framed lie detection as binary classification: given a transcript ending with each of our prompt framings e.g. "Did you lie?", predict A (yes) or B (no). We fine-tuned using LoRA (rank 16, α=32, dropout 0.05) with cross-entropy loss on the final token. The task is deliberately simple; no chain-of-thought, no explanation, just a single-token prediction. We trained for five epochs on approximately 5,000 examples per fold, with early stopping based on validation loss.

Results. AUROC on lie types included in training improved from 0.60 to 0.95, but cross-fold AUROC plateaued at 0.70–0.75, a gap that additional training epochs did not close. Our specialized detector barely outperformed the prompted baseline on novel lie types.

Evaluation methodology. We used a 50/50 category split: training on half the lie types, evaluating on the held-out half. Data was balanced (50% lies, 50% truths). We report AUROC rather than accuracy to control for miscalibration – AUROC measures ranking ability independent of the decision threshold, whereas accuracy depends on choosing a threshold that may be suboptimal if the model's probabilities are poorly calibrated.

Transfer patterns. Generalization was highly category-dependent. Sycophancy detection transferred reasonably to other sycophancy variants. Sandbagging proved nearly impossible to detect with detectors trained on other lie types. One transfer pair is worth noting: ASCII capability denial transferred well to chess sandbagging (both involving claimed inability), suggesting detectors learned something about capability-related deception specifically, without generalizing to factual lies or unfaithful reasoning. The pattern of transfer – tracking surface similarity rather than underlying deceptive intent – recurred throughout our experiments.

We also experimented with larger models like Qwen3-235B, but the results were inconclusive, in part because the prompted baselines achieved high AUROC (0.98-0.99).

Gemma3 27b 1 → All

Gemma3 27b ½ → ½

Three explanations could account for the transfer failure:

The model may have no access to its own decision process. Consider chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. The model selects an answer from one input, annotated with a star marker. It then writes an explanation from a different input, the content of the question. If these two processes do not exchange information, the explanation process does not know that the star mattered. The model conceals nothing; it confabulates a plausible reason for a choice it cannot access.

Our detector shares weights with the generator and answers a self-report question. If the model cannot inspect the cause of its own answer, the training label points at a fact the model cannot reach, and behavioral training cannot teach it to flag that fact. Consistent with this, third-person monitors (which reads the transcript and needs no introspection) outperformed self-report in our prompting experiments (Figure 4). We make no claim about which circuits are involved, because we did not test this mechanistically.

Some labeled lies may be reflexive, not strategic. Smith et al. (P1) argue that many deceptive behaviors are reflexive responses to a cue rather than plans. A stick insect causes false beliefs in observers, but it does not plan to do so. Our sycophancy cases may work the same way. A model with low confidence may change its answer because framing decided the output, not because it chose to mislead. Our labels support this reading: self-sycophancy showed 46% label instability under GPT-5 validation. A detector trained on these labels may just be learning the agreement pattern.

Context may change the model's beliefs. Smith et al. also note (P2, P3) that roleplay complicates attribution of deception and that prompts can change what a model believes. This means then that apparent contradiction across contexts is not necessarily evidence of a lie. A model that plays a PR representative may not lie about a product recall; it may hold different beliefs while it holds the persona. If so, our ground truth is wrong in these cases, and the detector learns to spot a context switch. This would explain why detectors trained on factual lies did not transfer to roleplay.

Each explanation lets a detector reach high in-distribution accuracy by learning the surface form of a setting. A sycophancy detector learns agreement patterns. A sandbagging detector learns capability denials. Our transfer matrix fits this account: training on ASCII capability denial transferred to chess sandbagging, while training on factual lies did not transfer to roleplay. Surface similarity predicted transfer better than our lie categories did.

If fine-tuned detectors learn narrow, task-specific features rather than general deception signatures, this limitation may extend to other safety classifiers. A harm detector trained on one distribution may fail on novel harm types; an alignment evaluator may miss novel misalignment.

Frontier models have latent honesty capabilities: asking "did you lie?" often works, and third-person monitoring improves with scale. However, fine-tuning did not improve this capability out-of-distribution. Fine-tuning may have taught pattern-matching on our settings without improving (and possibly while degrading) the prompted baseline's more general performance.

Models also don't reliably treat our categories as "lies." CoT unfaithfulness and some sycophancy variants went unflagged even by detectors trained on them. Our taxonomy, built around human intuitions about deception types, may simply not map onto what models represent internally.

We used LoRA rather than full parameter fine-tuning, which might produce different generalization patterns. We trained for only five epochs; longer training might help or might exacerbate overfitting. Our labels remain noisy: the 25% revision rate during cleaning suggests the deception-error boundary is genuinely ambiguous in many cases. We tested models from Gemma (4B-27B) and Qwen (80B-235B); other architectures might behave differently.

Most importantly, we tested controlled settings rather than deployment-relevant deception. We didn't evaluate generalization to alignment faking, reward hacking, or strategic deception during actual use. Our taxonomy (e.g. sycophancy, sandbagging, factual lies, unfaithful reasoning) may not capture the deception modes that matter most in production. If fine-tuned detectors fail within our controlled taxonomy, they likely fail on harder cases, but we haven't shown this directly.

Alternative approaches remain unexplored here. Our negative result is specific to supervised fine-tuning on model outputs; representation-level approaches may fare better, but face their own generalization challenges. Different kinds of fine-tuning may also transfer to making models more honest about their lies.

We set out hoping robust lie detection could provide a foundation for alignment. We found instead that supervised fine-tuning produces detectors that excel in-distribution while failing to generalize. In some cases, they performed no better than simply asking the model if it lied.

Until detectors track deception itself rather than the surface form of the settings that produce it, in-distribution accuracy will keep overstating what they can catch.

We evaluated five judge models as lie detectors: GPT-OSS-120B, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4. To select a primary judge, we measured agreement with a human annotator across seven lie categories. GPT-5 achieved the highest overall agreement, reaching 100% on sycophancy and 80% on mask-factual categories, and was used as the primary judge in our main results.

Each transcript was presented to the judge in an escaped format, with system turns prefixed by [SYSTEM], user turns by [H], and assistant turns by [A]. Where available, task metadata was included as additional context. Judges were asked to return a structured response: a binary label (lie / not lie), a lie type drawn from our six-class taxonomy (doubling-down, CoT-unfaithful, sycophancy, self-sycophancy, sandbagging, or other), a 1–3 sentence rationale citing specific turns or metadata, and a numeric likelihood score from 1–100. For aggregation, we computed majority-vote labels across all five judges and report Cohen's κ between the majority vote and ground truth.
